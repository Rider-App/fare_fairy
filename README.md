Fare Fairy is an API that integrates with Uber, Lyft, Taxi Fare Finder and Google Maps Directions APIs all at once. The Fare Fairy takes starting and destination addresses, converts them into latitude and longitude, gets estimates for time and cost from each transit API, then reports them back in one cohesive package. Because she's helpful like that.

See Fare Fairy in action at [farefairy.us]("http://farefairy.us").

This app served as the final project of Cohort 6 at The Iron Yard, and was initially built to support the needs of [Rider]("http://riderapp.us"), but it's now available to anyone who wants to use the data. If you'd like more information or access to the API, feel free to contact any of the contributors to this repository.
