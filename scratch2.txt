Your commute is usually about 20 minutes, but your train has stopped at the
next station for no reason. Again. Fuckin' Chicago. You get off and have to
formulate a plan of attack by the time you walk up the stairs. How are you
getting to work?

Ask Rider. It gives you the cost and estimated time of all your transportation
options.

Rider is a mobile-first Angular app that pulls information from Uber, Lyft,
GoogleTransit and Taxi Fare Finder to give you the fastest (or cheapest) route
to wherever you're going. It's powered by FareFairy, the (fully documented)
custom API that calls each transportation API individually and returns the
information to the front end as a single object. Each session generates a Google
Map of your route above your results, so you're in the know as soon as you
click go. Users can log in if they want to keep a list of favorite locations,
but no one needs credentials to use it.
