USER STORIES as focus of presentation

nikki: problem
tell story "and this is where RiderApp comes in "

jim: mechanics
explain app (mechanics of using it--click this and get this info), four APIs user can enter starting location and calls are made to Uber, Lyft, Google Transit and Taxi FareFinder
we return results with time and cost of transportation

kevin: app pages
(how user can get from our app to Uber) from there, users can call Uber, get a taxi, whatever they're feeling. talk about each page

jefferson: accounts
talk about user accounts and favorites

AND THIS IS HOW WE DID IT

kate: tech
this is built with a rails backend and it calls all the APIs from which we return a single API for the FE

alex: design
talks about design decisions


WHAT WE DO

Fare Fairy powers the Rider app, an Angular app that gives you information from the Uber, Lyft, Taxi Fare Finder and Google Transit APIs all at once. The Fare Fairy takes starting and destination addresses, converts them into latitude and longitude, asks each of the APIs their estimates for time and cost, then reports back to Rider. Because she's helpful like that.

This app served as the final project of Cohort 6 at The Iron Yard. If you want more information or access to the API, feel free to contact any of the team members below.

many loose things


maybe make FareFairy real, add real documentation
describe endpoints and such
  how authentication works

doc standards
  there's a gem SWAGGER








  module Api
      module V1
      class FavoritesController < ApplicationController
        before_action :set_user
        before_action :authenticate_user_favorite, only: [:update, :destroy]

          respond_to :json

            swagger_controller :favorites, 'Favorites'

            swagger_api :index do
              summary 'Returns all posts'
              notes 'Notes...'
            end
