      description: |
        FareFairy works with the Rider app to call the APIs of Uber, Lyft, Taxi Fare Finder and Google Transit
        to return several transportation options to the user. FareFairy first translates the addresses into
        latitude and longitude through Google GeoLocator. Fares is the controller that collects all this
        information and sends it through as a single API call to Rider.

  #     summary: Price Estimates
  #     description: |
  #       The Price Estimates endpoint returns an estimated price range
  #       for each product offered at a given location. The price estimate is
  #       provided as a formatted string with the full price range and the localized
  #       currency symbol.<br><br>The response also includes low and high estimates,
  #       and the [ISO 4217](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) currency code for
  #       situations requiring currency conversion. When surge is active for a particular
  #       product, its surge_multiplier will be greater than 1, but the price estimate
  #       already factors in this multiplier.
